## Welcome!

**Cedar** is an open source policy language and evaluation engine. Cedar enables developers to express fine-grained permissions as easy-to-understand policies enforced in their applications, and decouple access control from application logic. Cedar supports common authorization models such as role-based access control and attribute-based access control. It is the first policy language built from the ground up to be verified formally by using automated reasoning, and tested rigorously using differential random testing.
