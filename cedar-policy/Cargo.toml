# Hack to enable the `integration_testing` feature for the `Cedar` integration
# tests without enabling it by default for ordinary consumers of `Cedar`. The
# `default-features = false` stops this dependency from forcibly enabling the
# default features of `Cedar`, leaving the default features to be controlled by
# the ordinary `--no-default-features` flag of `cargo test`. See
# https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2911#issuecomment-1483256987 for
# more information. That issue also tracks a real solution to the problem that
# could replace this hack.
