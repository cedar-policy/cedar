# This script ensures that exceptions to the clippy lints have explanations in
# the comments. It assumes that clippy is properly configured to forbid the
# lints listed in `panic_markers` and that clippy is being run regularly.
# Clippy is automatically run against PRs on GitHub.  Clippy lints are
# controlled for all of our crates by `./.cargo/config.toml`.
