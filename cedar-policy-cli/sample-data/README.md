# Cedar CLI Examples

This folder contains several examples of using the Cedar CLI. `sandbox_a`, `sandbox_b`, and `sandbox_c` contain a tutorial-style presentation using the example PhotoFlash application described in the [Cedar language guide](https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/overview/scenario.html). `sandbox_a` focuses on RBAC policies, `sandbox_b` focuses on ABAC policies, and `sandbox_c` focuses on templates.

`tiny_sandboxes` contains a variety of smaller examples that demonstrate how to use different CLI commands.
