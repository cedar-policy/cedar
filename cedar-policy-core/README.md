# cedar-policy-core

This package contains the Cedar parser and evaluation engine.

This package exposes low-level and advanced Cedar APIs, e.g.,
for interacting with policy ASTs directly.
Anyone simply wanting to use Cedar from a Rust client (e.g.,
to make authorization decisions) should use
[`cedar-policy`](../cedar-policy) instead.

For more information about the Cedar language/project, please take a look
at [cedarpolicy.com](https://www.cedarpolicy.com).
