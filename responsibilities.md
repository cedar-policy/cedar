## Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are active and visible members of the community, and have [maintain-level permissions on a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization). Use those privileges to serve the community and evolve code as follows.

* Uphold Code of Conduct
* Model the behavior set forward by the Code of Conduct and raise any violations to other maintainers and admins.
* Prioritize Security
* Security is your number one priority. Maintainer's Github keys must be password protected securely and any reported security vulnerabilities are addressed before features or bugs. Note that this repository is monitored and supported 24/7 by Amazon Security, see [Reporting a Vulnerability](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for details.
* Review pull requests regularly, comment, suggest, reject, merge and close. Accept only high quality pull-requests.
*  Provide code reviews and guidance on incoming pull requests. Don't let PRs be stale and do your best to be helpful to contributors.
* Triage Open Issues
* Manage labels, review issues regularly, and triage by labelling them.
* Be Responsive
* Respond to enhancement requests, and forum posts. Allocate time to reviewing and commenting on issues and conversations as they come in.
* Maintain Overall Health of the Repo
* Keep the `main` branch at production quality at all times. Backport features as needed. Cut release branches and tags to enable future patches.
* Keep Dependencies up to Date
* Assist, add, and remove MAINTAINERS. 
* Make sure the repo has a well-written, accurate, and complete description.
