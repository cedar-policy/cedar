# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- The `-p`/`--policies` flag can now be omitted across all subcommands where it
  is present. If the flag is omitted, policies will be read from `stdin`.
- `--policy-format` flag to many subcommands, allowing you to pass policies in
  JSON format. The default remains `human` format.
- The `validate` command now takes a `--template-linked` / `-k` optional argument,
  allowing you to validate template-linked policies.
- The `check-parse` command also now takes a `--template-linked` / `-k` optional
  argument, allowing you to check whether a template-linked-policies file parses.
- The `--template-linked` / `-k` argument is now also optional to `link`
  (previously required). If not provided, the linked policy will only be shown on
  stdout; if it is provided, the indicated file will be updated with the new link
  (as before).

## 3.0.1

## 3.0.0

Now uses Cedar language version 3.0.0.

### Added

- `--deny-warnings` option to `validate` command. This option turns non-fatal
  warnings into errors.
- Requests are now validated by default if a schema is provided. This can be
  disabled with `--request-validation=false`.
- The `-s` short form can now be used for `--schema` across all subcommands.

### Changed

- The `-p` flag now always refers to `--policies` (not `--principal`) across all
  subcommands, while `-l` refers to `--principal`. Relatedly, the `--policies`
  long form of the flag is also now accepted across all subcommands.
- The short form of `--template-linked` was changed from `-t` to `-k`.
- The `format` subcommand no longer takes a positional file argument.
