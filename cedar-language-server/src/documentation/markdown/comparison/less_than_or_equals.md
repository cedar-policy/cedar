# <= *(less than or equal)*

## Usage:
```cedar
<long> <= <long>
```

Binary operator that compares two long integer operands and evaluates to true
if the left operand is numerically less than or equal to the right operand. If either
operand is not a long then evaluation (and validation) results in an error.
