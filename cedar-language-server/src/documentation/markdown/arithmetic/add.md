# + *(numeric addition)*

## Usage:
```cedar
<long> + <long>
```

Binary operator that adds two long integer values and returns their sum. Both operands
must be long integers or evaluation and validation will result in an error. Addition
operations that result in overflow will fail at evaluation time, but will pass validation.
